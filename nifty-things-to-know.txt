# solidity style guide https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/style-guide.html
# just consult the guide when writing contracts 

# to show what needs testing, what lines are uncovered
yarn hardhat coverage

# for running /test
yarn hardhat test

# Fixed an error when `yarn hardhat test` unknown function getAddress or something like that
yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers

#to run a single test, grep it's description
yarn hardhat test --grep "amount funded"

# Learned about debugging, clicking the red dot on a line of code to halt exec
# Press run and debug, hit js debug terminal

# Storage vs state
# Storage persists GLOBALLY in an array, with the contract
# State gets deleted, anything inside a function is state

# From ethers docs https://docs.ethers.io/v5/single-page/
# ({ value: sendValue }) writes value: sendvalue, value to be sent to smart contract

git remote add origin github.com/repolink
git remote -v (to see push and pull repo targets)
git push origin master
# whatever the name of local branch is in place of master
